Mental disorders have a variety of symptoms but the common ones are changes in mood, personality, personal habits and/or social withdrawal. Here is the list of mental disorders:</p>
        
        
        <h3 class="depreshead" id="depres">Depression</h3>
        <p class="depres">Depression is the constant feeling of sadness with the loss of interest, the stop of your normal activities. It also affects how people think, feel, and act.</p>
        <p class="depres">Different types of depression exist: </p>
        <ul class="depres" id="depul">
            <li class="depres depli">Major depression - a common form of depression, it can be mild, moderate, or severe. Other terms are unipolar depression or clinical depression.</li>
            <li class="depres depli">Melancholia - the older term of depression and is used to describe the more severe form depression, where many physical symptoms are more prominent. Ex. Big changes in sleep patterns. People are more likely to lose interest in almost everything. </li>
            <li class="depres depli">Dysthymia - Sometimes called Persistent Depressive Disorder. Symptoms are similar to major depression but less severe and are ongoing.</li>
            <li class="depres depli">Psychotic Depression - losing touch with reality, examples are hallucinations or delusions.</li>
            <li class="depres depli">Bipolar Disorder - formerly known as manic depression. Causes extreme mood swings with emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). When depressed you feel sad and hopeless, when shifted to mania or hypomania you feel full of energy. These swings can affect sleep energy, behavior, and the ability to think.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="depres">Symptoms ranging from minor to severe. Depression causes negative feelings; sadness, misery, unhappiness, overwhelmedness, lack of confidence, etc. It also causes negative thoughts like ‘It’s my fault’, ‘Things will never change.’, ‘People will be better off without me.’ etc.</p>
         <p class="depres">People with depression have different behavioural and physical symptoms.

Physically people will feel tired all the time, feel sick, pains in the head, stomach or muscles, issues with sleep, change in appetite, and change in weight.</p>
         <p class="depres">Depression does not result from one singular event but multiple events and factors. There is no known cause of depression but it can form. Events like living in an abusive and/or uncaring relationship, long-term isolation/loneliness, or long term exposure to stress increase the risk of depression. Big events that suddenly take place like losing a job, divorce/separation,  and/or being diagnosed with a serious illness also affect.</p>
         <p class="depres">Risks that can cause depression is:</p>
        <ul class="depres depul">
            <li class="depres depli">Family history - depression can run in families which increase genetic risk.</li>
             <li class="depres depli">Personality - due to one’s personality can cause depression. Example: if one tends to worry, have low self-esteem, or is sensitive to negativity, they are at higher risk. </li>
             <li class="depres depli">Medical condition - it can trigger depression by either directly bringing it out or contributing to it.</li>
             <li class="depres depli">Drug and alcohol use - can both lead and be a result.</li>
        </ul>
         <p class="depres">Depression can go months, possibly years without being recognised. If left untreated it will have a negative impact on one’s life such as relationships and family problems, difficulty with a job, and/or drug and alcohol problems. Depression is common and treatable with effective treatment. There is no exact way to treat depression but there is a range of treatments and health professionals that can help on the road to recovery.</p>
